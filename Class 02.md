> ## 1. Text

* There are two main HTML Tags:

   1. Structural Markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
   
   2. Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence
   
* Some Semantic tags: 
    
   1. Heading <h1>-<h6>
   
         <h1>: Used for Headings 
   
         <h2>-<h6>: Used for Subheading
   
   2. Paragraph <p>: To create a paragraph
   
   3. Bold <b>: for bold text
   
   4. Italic <i>: for italic text
       
   5. Suberscript & Subscript: The <sup> element is used to contain characters that hould be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts, The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript.
   
   6. Line Breaks <br>
   
   7. Horizontal Rules <hr>
   
   8. Strong <strong>: The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. 
   
   9. Emphasis <em>: The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. 
   
   10. Quotations <blockquote>: The <blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.
   
   11. Abbreviations <abbr>: If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <abbr> element can be used.
   
   12. Citations <cite>: When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the <cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
   
   13. Definition <dfn>: The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining instance of it.
   
   14. Author Details <address>: The <address> element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.
   
   15. <ins> <del>: The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.
   
   16. The <s> element indicates something that is no longer  accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).
